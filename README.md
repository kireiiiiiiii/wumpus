# 🏹 Hunt the Wumpus

This is a submission for the 2025 Redmond High School event _Hunt the Wumpus_ by [Matej Stastny](https://github.com/kireiiiiiiii), [Samuel](https://github.com/Snapshot20) and [Moby](https://github.com/MobyWonKenobi) made in Godot 4.2.

## ⚙️ Installation (for devs)

To set up the project for development, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Git**:

   - Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
   - Follow the instructions for your operating system.

2. **Install Godot Engine**:
   - Download and install _Godot 4.2.2_ using [this link](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2.2-stable/).

### Setup

If you just installed git you will need to do some config. Open up a terminal, and execute the following commands. Replace `your-name` and `your-email` with your actual name and email. It is best practice to use the same email as your GitHub account uses.

```sh

git config --global user.name "your-name-here"
git config --global user.email your-email-here

```

### Cloning

1. Open a terminal in the location you want to have the project folder in.

2. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kireiiiiiiii/wumpus.git
   cd wumpus
   ```

3. **Open the project in Godot**:

   - Launch Godot Engine.
   - Click on the `Import` button.
   - Navigate to the cloned repository folder and select `open this folder` at the botom.

4. **Run the project**:
   - Once the project is loaded in Godot, click the `Play` button to run the game (top left).

You are now ready to start developing and hunting the Wumpus!
